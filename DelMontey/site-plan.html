        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea is that people will come to my site for several reasons. 
        Primarily because they like my music and they want to learn more about either the creative process, when they can see me play live or how they can support. 
        The other reason that they’ll likely stop by is to buy merchandise, whether this be shirts, jackets, vinyl records anything of the sort this is likely why they will be there.
        I’m hoping that I can draw them in by actually making decent music to listen to so that their interest will be peaked in what I have to offer.
        
        I’m hoping that the website answers questions about who I am and what I do. 
        I really hope that when people get on my website they can look at it and just say “wow that is so Jake” or something of the sorts. 
        I really want it to convey how much music means to me and what type of music I make. It should also answer when they can see me live next or how they can support me in my endeavors. 
        I also really hope it inspires people to answer their own personal questions, where they want to go who they want to be, what type of life they want to live etc.

      <h3>Current Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The types of things they’re going to be completing on my website are largely going to be transactional based. 
        They’ll be able to by merchandise, and concert tickets directly from the website. 
        I think the focus of it is going to be where they can go to hear my music as well. I’m not trying to build a streaming platform, I am however trying to guide people to my streaming services. I’m going to do my best to put my music on services like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and more. 
        I would love to have an API work with all 3 so that people can listen through their preferred streaming service on the website, but that likely will be much to complicated, so I’ll likely just have the links to take them there.

      </ul>
      <h3>MERCH</h3>
      <p>
        There’s not much information that should be needed to complete any actions that I offer. 
        If it’s anything transactional obviously the clients are going to need their card information and address to purchase and ship any items. 
        This information will also obviously have to be securely, stored. This is something that I doubt I’ll be able to actually do initially but it is something I’d like to add onto and at least have a beta feature of. I will also need to figure out a way to include YouTube videos and audio into the website as well. I think in order to do the latter successfully I would also need to figure out how to use a YouTube API in the process, which might be a bit challenging. 
        If I could do this however I think it would help make my website much more successful than it would be without. 

        People are going to be coming to my website because of the music that I make, and the merchandise that is sold there. 
        I’m not going to put any other artist’s information on there for right now, if they want to listen to another artist that’s more than fine, but it’s not going to be on my website. 
        This website is going to be built for those who are genuinely interested in listening to the stuff I make and the things I do. 
        This is going to be the place for them to make a connection with me and hopefully with other people with similar interests.
